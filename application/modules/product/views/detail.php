                <b>PPL(A) – FLYING FOR PLEASURE</b><br/>
                Private Pilot Licence PPL(A) is the most suitable option, if you wish to fly just for your own personal needs or pleasure, for example:
              </p>
              <p>
                PPL is the only aviation training program which does not require the specific knowledge of exact sciences;<br/>
                Continue by taking some aerobatics lessons and diving into the amazing world of stunts such as rolls and loops;<br/>
                Sometimes the aviation is the only option of transportation. There are districts problematic for on ground communication so the light type aircrafts are the only possibility to transfer subjects or services crucial for survival;<br/>
                After the work day take a flight alone and enjoy the peace of mind that flights in single-engine airplanes bring;<br/>
                Share the beauty of sights from the sky by flying with your family or friends on weekends.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>CPL(A) – COMMERCIAL PILOT LICENCE</b><br/>
                You may also choose CPL (A) modular course which takes longer but you have an advantage to stop at any moments of your studies leaving with PPL or CPL licences.
              </p>
              <p>
                After finishing the course you will get a CPL(A) and an ATPL(frozen)*, which means you can start flying small commercial airliner up to 9 seats or start looking for a job as a first officer at airlines.
              </p>
              <p>
                The decision how to start an aviation career or what pilot training program to choose can be made only after some considerations as it is know that aviation studies requires substantial investment. The most optimum way to find out the best solutions is to conduct a thorough research and definitely use the consultancies of various aviation training centres.
